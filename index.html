         BTS (Korean: 방탄소년단; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan; lit. Bulletproof Boy Scouts), also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a
         South Korean boy band formed in 2010. The band consists of Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook, who
         co-write or co-produce much of their material. Originally a hip hop group, they expanded their musical style to
         incorporate a wide range of genres, while their lyrics have focused on subjects including mental health, the
         troubles of school-age youth and coming of age, loss, the journey towards self-love, individualism, and the
         consequences of fame and recognition. Their discography and adjacent work has also referenced literature,
         philosophy and psychology, and includes an alternate universe storyline. BTS fandom is called an ARMY.
